# ðŸ§  Python + OpenCV Learning Journey

Welcome to my Computer Vision learning repository!  
This project contains hands-on implementations of image processing techniques using **Python** and **OpenCV**.
ðŸ“Œ What I Learned
ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts
- Reading and displaying images/videos
- Resizing and scaling
- Drawing shapes and adding text
- Contour detection

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Techniques
- Color space conversion (BGR, HSV, LAB)
- Image smoothing and blurring
- Masking and bitwise operations
- Histogram plotting and edge detection (Canny)
- Thresholding & binarization

ðŸ”¹ Face Recognition Projects
- Face detection using Haar Cascades
- Face recognition using OpenCVâ€™s LBPH face recognizer


ðŸ›  Installation
To run these notebooks or Python files locally:

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kalyanijha445/Python_OpenCV_Learning.git
cd Python_OpenCV_Learning
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows
3. Install the required packages
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
